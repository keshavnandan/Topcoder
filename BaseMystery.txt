PROBLEM STATEMENT

The base of a number system is the number of different values each digit can represent.  For example, in base-2 (binary), there are 2 values each digit can take: 0 and 1.  In base-10, a digit can take values 0 through 9, inclusive.  Sometimes, it is difficult to determine which base a numerical expression is in.  An equation is valid for a given base if all of the digits are less than the base, and the numerical meaning of the equation is correct.  For example, "1+1=10" for base-10 satisfies the rule that the digits are all less than 10, but 1+1 = 2 in base-10, so the equation is not correct for base-10.



If we assume that the characters '0'-'9' represent the values 0 - 9, and the characters 'A'-'J' represent the values 10 - 19, then we can represent numbers with a base up to 20.  The equation will be in the following form:


<num>+<num>=<num>


Where each <num> is a string consisting of characters '0'-'9' and 'A'-'J', which does not have any extra leading zeros, and is at most 5 digits long.



Given an equation as defined above, you should return which bases in the range of 2 to 20, inclusive, are valid for the equation.  Return the bases in a vector <int> in ascending order.


DEFINITION
Class:BaseMystery
Method:getBase
Parameters:string
Returns:vector <int>
Method signature:vector <int> getBase(string equation)


CONSTRAINTS
-equation will be of the form "<num>+<num>=<num>"
-Each <num> in equation will have between 1 and 5 characters, inclusive.
-Each <num> in equation will consist only of numeric digits '0' - '9' and capital letters 'A' - 'J', and will not have extra leading zeros.


EXAMPLES

0)
"1+1=2"

Returns: { 3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9,  10,  11,  12,  13,  14,  15,  16,  17,  18,  19,  20 }


The only base which this does not work for is base-2.  In base 2, 2 is represented by "10"


1)
"1+1=10"

Returns: { 2 }


The same equation valid for base 2.


2)
"1+1=3"

Returns: { }


1+1 is never 3, no matter what base you are in.


3)
"ABCD+211=B000"

Returns: { 14 }


In base-14, the digits are 0-9, A-D.  Adding one to the ones column yields 10 base-14, which carries over to make the 10's column a 'D'.  Adding 1 to that column yields 10 again, which carries and makes the 100's column a 'C'.  Adding 2 to C yields 10 again, which adds 1 to the 1000's column, resulting in B000.


4)
"ABCD+322=B000"

Returns: { 15 }


For base-15, we have increased the number required to wrap to 0 by 1.


5)
"1+0=1"

Returns: { 2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9,  10,  11,  12,  13,  14,  15,  16,  17,  18,  19,  20 }


This is valid for all bases.


6)
"GHIJ+1111=HJ00"

Returns: { 20 }

7)
"1234+8765=9999"

Returns: { 10,  11,  12,  13,  14,  15,  16,  17,  18,  19,  20 }
