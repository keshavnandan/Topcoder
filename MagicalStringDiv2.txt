PROBLEM STATEMENT
Magical Girl Illy uses "magical strings" to cast spells.
For her, a string X is magical if and only if there exists a positive integer k such that X is composed of k consecutive '>' characters followed by k consecutive '<' characters.

Illy wants to change S into a magical string.
