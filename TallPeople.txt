PROBLEM STATEMENT
A group of people stand before you arranged in rows and columns.  Looking from above, they form an R by C rectangle of people.  You will be given a vector <string> people containing the height of each person.  Elements of people correspond to rows in the rectangle.  Each element contains a space-delimited list of integers representing the heights of the people in that row.  Your job is to return 2 specific heights in a vector <int>.  The first is computed by finding the shortest person in each row, and then finding the tallest person among them (the "tallest-of-the-shortest").  The second is computed by finding the tallest person in each column, and then finding the shortest person among them (the "shortest-of-the-tallest").

DEFINITION
Class:TallPeople
Method:getPeople
Parameters:vector <string>
Returns:vector <int>
Method signature:vector <int> getPeople(vector <string> people)


CONSTRAINTS
-people will contain between 2 and 50 elements inclusive.
-Each element of people will contain between 3 and 50 characters inclusive.
-Each element of people will be a single space-delimited list of positive integers such that: 1) Each positive integer is between 1 and 1000 inclusive with no extra leading zeros.2) Each element contains the same number of integers.3) Each element contains at least 2 positive integers.4) Each element does not contain leading or trailing whitespace.


EXAMPLES

0)
{"9 2 3",
 "4 8 7"}

Returns: { 4,  7 }

The heights 2 and 4 are the shortest from the rows, so 4 is the taller of the two.  The heights 9, 8, and 7 are the tallest from the columns, so 7 is the shortest of the 3.

1)
{"1 2",
 "4 5",
 "3 6"}

Returns: { 4,  4 }

2)
{"1 1",
 "1 1"}

Returns: { 1,  1 }
