Manao is playing a solitaire game called OR-solitaire. In this game, the player starts with a number X = 0 and should obtain the number goal in one or more moves. The set of valid moves is determined by a vector <int> numbers. In each move, the player chooses some element of numbers and replaces X with the bitwise OR of X and the chosen element.

Fox Ciel wants Manao to stop playing OR-solitaire and move on with his life. She decided to erase some of the elements from numbers in such a way that it becomes impossible to complete the game. Return the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to achieve this.

DEFINITION
Class:ORSolitaireDiv2
Method:getMinimum
Parameters:vector <int>, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int getMinimum(vector <int> numbers, int goal)


NOTES
-If a and b are single bits then a | b is defined as max(a, b). For two integers, A and B, in order to calculate A | B, they need to be represented in binary: A = (an...a1)2, B = (bn...b1)2 (if the lengths of their representations are different, the shorter one is prepended with the necessary number of leading zeroes). Then A | B = C = (cn...c1)2, where ci = ai | bi. For example, 10 | 3 = (1010)2 | (0011)2 = (1011)2 = 11.


CONSTRAINTS
-numbers will contain between 1 and 20 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of numbers will be between 1 and 1,000,000,000.
-The elements in numbers will be distinct.
-goal will be between 1 and 1,000,000,000.


EXAMPLES

0)
{1, 2, 4}
7

Returns: 1

The goal of the game is to obtain X = 7 from X = 0. The possible moves are to replace X with bitwise OR of X and 1, bitwise OR of X and 2 and bitwise OR of X and 4. X = 7 can be obtained only by using each of the three moves at least once, so removing any single element from numbers will make the game impossible to finish.

1)
{1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
7

Returns: 2

In this example, Fox Ciel should remove the number 7 and one of the numbers 1, 2, 4.

2)
{12571295, 2174218, 2015120}
1

Returns: 0

There is no need to remove elements from numbers, since the game cannot be completed in its initial version.

3)
{5, 2, 4, 52, 62, 9, 8, 3, 1, 11, 6}
11

Returns: 3



4)
{503, 505, 152, 435, 491, 512, 1023, 355, 510, 500, 502, 255, 63, 508, 509, 511, 60, 250, 254, 346}
510

Returns: 5
