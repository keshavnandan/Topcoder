PROBLEM STATEMENT

It's winter time!
You have some candies arranged in a row and now you want to choose some of them and give them to your friend.




You are given a vector <int> type.
Each candy has a type, which is some positive integer.
For each i, type[i] represents the type of i-th candy.
You want to choose some non-empty subset of candies with the following property:
if the number of candies you choose is K, their types must be precisely all the numbers from 1 to K, inclusive.
Return the number of different ways to do that.
(Two ways are considered different if there exists some candy that is chosen in only one of them.)


DEFINITION
Class:WinterAndCandies
Method:getNumber
Parameters:vector <int>
Returns:int
Method signature:int getNumber(vector <int> type)


NOTES
-The answer will always fit in a signed 32-bit integer.


CONSTRAINTS
-type will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of type will be between 1 and 50, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{1, 3, 2}

Returns: 3

There are 7 possible non-empty subsets in this case:


(1)


(3)


(2)


(1, 3)


(1, 2)


(3, 2)


(1, 3, 2)


Out of them, only first, fifth and seventh are valid. Thus, the answer is 3.

1)
{1, 1, 2}

Returns: 4

Note that the chosen subset can never contain two elements with the same type.

2)
{1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 4, 5, 4}

Returns: 9



3)
{1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5}

Returns: 62



4)
{2}

Returns: 0
