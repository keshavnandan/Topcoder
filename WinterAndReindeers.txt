PROBLEM STATEMENT

It's winter time! Time to play some games.




Four reindeers are playing the following game.
The first three of them choose three non-empty strings: A, B, and C. (The strings are not necessarily distinct.)
Then, the fourth one (and it happens to be the youngest one) finds a string S that satisfies the following conditions:



S is a subsequence of A. (I.e., either S equals A, or S can be obtained from A by removing some of its characters.)


S is a subsequence of B.


C is a (contiguous) substring of S.


There is no string longer than S that satisfies the previous three conditions.





You are given three vector <string>s allA, allB and allC.
Concatenate all elements of allA, allB and allC to obtain strings A, B and C, respectively.
Return the length of the string S.
If there is no such string, return 0.


DEFINITION
Class:WinterAndReindeers
Method:getNumber
Parameters:vector <string>, vector <string>, vector <string>
Returns:int
Method signature:int getNumber(vector <string> allA, vector <string> allB, vector <string> allC)


CONSTRAINTS
-allA, allB and allC will each contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of allA, allB and allC will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-Each element of allA, allB and allC will consist only of uppercase English letters ('A'-'Z').


EXAMPLES

0)
{"X"}
{"X", "Y"}
{"X"}

Returns: 1

In this case, A = "X", B = "XY", C = "X". The longest possible string that satisfies conditions from the statement is "X". Thus, the answer is 1.

1)
{"ABCXD"}
{"BCDEF"}
{"CD"}

Returns: 3

The longest possible string in this case is "BCD".

2)
{"WE", "LOVE"}
{"WORKING", "FOR", "SANTA"}
{"JK"}

Returns: 0

No string satisfies all criteria in this case. Thus, the answer is 0.

3)
{"ABCDE"}
{"CDEAB"}
{"B"}

Returns: 2



4)
{"ABCABDEGAXAHDJBAAHFJDXBB", "ABHFHCDALFDJDBBA", "BABBAXAXXX"}
{"ABLOCBAXBAHAJDXBIJKA", "JBABCDAHKFIUDALPJAH", "AABACX"}
{"AXBADXBBAB", "CDD"}

Returns: 23
