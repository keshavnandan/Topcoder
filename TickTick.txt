PROBLEM STATEMENT
Our computer clock is not continuous.  It "ticks" every millisecond and keeps
track of how many ticks have occurred since the beginning of the "epoch"
(Jan 1, 1970). The clocktime does not change between ticks.

Time is continuous, and events (such as interrupts from hardware devices and
the starting of a program) can happen anytime. We have a program that 
experiences a sequence of events. At each event in our program, our logic gets 
the current clocktime and compares it with the clocktime stored from the
previous event. It outputs either 'D' or 'S' indicating whether the current
clocktime is Different or the Same as the previous event's clocktime. (The first event
after the program starts generates the first 'S' or 'D' based on comparison 
with the clocktime at the start of the program.)

Because the first tick during our program can occur anytime within one millisecond after the
start of the program, the string of 'D's and 'S's output from our program
cannot be predicted, even given the exact timing of the program.  Create a
class TickTick that contains a method count that is given event, a vector <string> 
of the times of events relative to the start of the program, and returns 
the number of different output sequences
that might be generated. The event times are given in milliseconds elapsed 
since the start of the program, formatted to contain digits and exactly one 
decimal point. 

Time is continuous, so exact coincidences do not occur (or occur with probability 0). You should not consider the
possibility that a tick occurs at exactly the same time as an event or at the exact 
start of the program. The constraints on event guarantee that two 
different events can never be exactly an integral number of
milliseconds apart. 



DEFINITION
Class:TickTick
Method:count
Parameters:vector <string>
Returns:int
Method signature:int count(vector <string> events)


CONSTRAINTS
-events has between 1 and 50 elements inclusive
-each element of events has length between 2 and 8, and contains exactly one decimal point '.'. All the other characters are digits '0'-'9'
-no element of events has a value equal to an integer
-no two elements of events have values that differ by an integer
-the elements of events have values that are strictly increasing


EXAMPLES

0)
{".222","00.223","1.221","4.220"}

Returns: 4


If the clock's first tick occurs approximately .100 milliseconds after the start of
the program,  then the clocktime at time .222
will be Different from the clocktime at the start. The clocktime at .223 will
be the same as at .222, the clocktime at 1.221 will be different from the
clocktime at .223 since a tick occurs at 1.100. The clocktime at 4.220 will 
always be different from the clocktime at 1.221. So in this case, the 
program generates DSDD.  Similarly, 
   if the clock's first tick is at .2215, DSSD
   if the clock's first tick is at .2225, SDSD
   if the clock's first tick is at .2235, SSDD 
These are the only possible sequences that can be generated. 



1)
{"4.220112","4.221","4.222","4.223"}

Returns: 4


    DSSS, DSSD, DSDS, DDSS

2)
{"123456.1","123456.7"}

Returns: 2

If the first tick occurs at .05 after the program starts, the 
output would be DS while if it occurs .5 after the program starts, then
the output would be DD. These are the only possible results.
